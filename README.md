# Pico-scale-R2-calculation
This Python code implements a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict power output of a pico-scale vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) based on wind speed (2–10 m/s), angle of attack (0–25°), obstacle height (0 or 1.4–2.5 m), and obstacle distance (1.9–2.1 m).
